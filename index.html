            <h2>Our Philosophy✨</h2><br>
                            
        <p>At Kenpo Karate, we teach from young children to adults, providing comprehensive training that covers mental, spiritual, and physiological attributes.</p><br>
        <p>Our holistic approach ensures that individuals improve in all areas of their lives throughout the art of Kenpo Karate and our paradigm about holistic training means for us mental, spiritual and physiological improving.</p><br>
        <p>Because of that, you will not only learn how to defend yourself, but how to find the self-control, self-steem, respect for yourself and all living creatures, to live in balance with everything.</p>
        <p>Our instructors are highly trained and experienced in delivering tailored programs that cater to the unique needs of each student. Also, We believe in fostering a positive and inclusive environment where everyone can grow and succeed.</p><br>
        <p>Kenpo Karate is more than just a martial art; as explain a bit above, it's a way of life, because once you learn to control yourself, to love yourself and respect others, your life start changing positively, in that way we are promoting discipline, respect, and perseverance. Our outermost goal is to develop well-rounded individuals who are confident, focused, and capable of achieving their goals.</p><br>
        <p>Because of all the mentioned above, we believe that Kenpo Karate is a life's style, a discipline a life's commitment to do our best with all living creatures and with ourselves.</p><br>
        
        <p>Our philosophy is based upon the respect to all living creatures, we seek to avoid all confrontations possibles and in return we build strong and self-confident martial art personalities, because If students build a stronger self-steem no matter what other say or other's provocations, they will keep calm, because we are not afraid of other's but we are afraid of what damage we could cause, and that is why we have a huge responsability upon</p><br>

        <p>Because of all that and much more not mentioned in here, we can assure you that you will see the benefits of training with us in the very first month.</p><br>

            <img src="You.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" alt="Kenpo Karate mixed pics">
        
        <p>My career in the martial arts started at the age of 1 year old, yes, you got It right! When I was 1 year old my father whom was the teacher of my mother set me my first Kung-fu suit with the white belt on</p><br>
        <p>When I was 3 years old I performed the first national exhibition with my father in a TV show there back in the 80's.</p><br>
        <p>Afterward I continue practicing many different martial art styles, like Taekwon-do, Karate-do, Shinto Ryu, Kempo, and kenpo karate where I continue practicing It with my own developing.</p><br>
        <p>Later on, I started my career as instructor when I was 16 years old, I had my first school with over 30 students.</p><br>
        <p>I travelled around the world to keep learning from great martial artists and acquiring more experience, but I started sharing my knowledge so that I taught martial arts in several countries like in the USA, in Chile, Argentina, Spain, Portugal, United Kingdom, Sweden and others.</p><br> 
        <p>Because of that I could grow as person, martial artist and professionally. Besides, I studied several things like philosophy, psychology, medicine and more, like programming.</p><br>
        <p>I participated among several tournaments where I was world champion in both kata and fighting, however, I don't limit a real success with how many world cups you win, but how much wisdom and fight you avoid in life, because a real winner is the one that could avoid a fight not involved in It.</p><br>
        <p>Abiding the above paradigm, I will prepare martial artists that will conquer themselves, because real life's enemy are ourselves and not all the way around.</p><br>
        <p>Today I am the Master of:</p><br>
